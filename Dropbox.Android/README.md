Dropbox Bindings for Xamarin.Android
===============

Follow the install instructions at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/sdks/android.
Do not forget to add the Dropbox native library files (*.SO) to your project and configure them as 'AndroidNativeLibrary' in 'Build action' of the Properties window.
These bindings are using the v13 Support Library and are compiling correctly using API 18.

Note: I do not guarantee in any way that these bindings actually work. I used them for testing purposes only.
